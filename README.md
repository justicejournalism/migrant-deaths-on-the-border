This data animation video tells the story of the increasing deaths at the U.S.-Mexico border. As the border becomes more militarized, migrants are crossing at more dangerous parts of the border.

About 6,000 have lost their lives since 2000, and in Arizona alone, there are 1,500 reported cases of missing migrants. The Colibrí Center for Human Rights in Tucson, which helps families search for their missing loved ones and forensic scientists identify the dead, plans to use the video in its work.
